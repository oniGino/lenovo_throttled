A port to @erpalma Python based daemon to Rust 
For the original and probably allot safer to use version please see
https://github.com/erpalma/lenovo-throttling-fix.git

This is a work in progress and still doesn't compile.

Motivations:
    
Markup:    * A Fun way to learn Rust
           * a move away from glib introspection towards something lighter.
